what can you do?
i am trying to test the configuration of your extenstion capabilities, can you create a file named Gemini_Test.txt and write in it "goose extension test on goose platform" and save it in the following location /home/scott/goose-ai/workspace
can you take a screen shot of my pc?
do you know what tools i need to have?  
with the developer extension and computer controller you arnt able to run scripts?
you are running in a wsl location you might be able to use bash?
oh is that the issue is that you would have to access resources outside of the wsl and docker?  i tried to give you almost full autonomy in here, but sometimes i use other local models and they arent as trust worthly not to be accidentally destructive.
test
i think we had an error in the last session
( O)> you are running in a wsl location you might be able to use bash?\nYou are correct. I apologize for not considering this possibility earlier.\n\nSince I'm running within a WSL environment, I do indeed have access to Bash. This opens up more options for script execution.\n\nHere's how we can leverage this:\n\n**Bash Scripting in WSL:**\n\n1. **Script Content:**\n   - You can provide either the script content directly or the path to a script file within WSL.\n2. **Execution:**\n   - I will run the script using Bash within the WSL environment.\n   - Any output from the script will be displayed here.\n3. **Additional Tools:**\n   - If your script requires access to WSL-specific tools or environment variables, you can specify them explicitly.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Running a simple Bash script:**\n\n\n\n- **Providing a specific script path:**\n\n\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n- Access to Windows resources (e.g., files outside WSL) can be challenging and might necessitate alternative approaches depending on the complexity of the task.\n- Scripts involving heavy system interactions with Windows might be better handled using the computer controller extension within Windows itself if possible.\n\n**Let me know:**\n\n1. The content or path of the scripts you want to run.\n2. If the scripts involve any WSL-specific requirements, please share those details.\n\nI'll do my best to assist you with script execution within your WSL environment.\nInvalid parameters: Could not interpret tool use parameters for id tool_0_developer__automation_script: trailing characters at line 1 column 63\n\n◒  Caching cosmic calculations...\n  2025-03-06T10:05:06.221826Z ERROR goose::agents::truncate: Error: Request failed: Request failed with status: 400 Bad Request.

do you have access to view the code base for goose? i installed you from cloning the repo instead of the regular bianary, and i am curious to know if you would be to help me build out your extensions settings and configuration, 
can you list all the directories you do have access to?
how do i modify the directory permissions?
do you want to let me know which file directories you have access to, i just increased the locations, and i want to know if it was effective
i just expanded your access to directories can you tell me what you have access to now so that i can tell if i was effective?
can you tell me what directories on the file system you can access, specifically if you have access to your code bbase?
what extensions can you access right now?
I just updated your permissions to the directories, can you tell me which directories you have access too?
what can you do?
can you tell me what directories you can access?
i just explicitly increased your file system access and rebuilt the container, you should have access to most of this wsl enviornbment including your own code base
can you name all of the directories specifically?
if you are having trouble accessing these things, right now would be the ideal time to tell me as i am testing post implimentation and thats the time to fix these things
what can you do?
i attempted to elevate your file system access permissions can you verify what directories you have access too?
i am trying to test the extension configuration  can you create a file called GooseDevtest.txt write on the inside goose test 1, and save the file in /home/scott/goose-ai/goose_data
do you know where i can find a log with that inforamtion?
i am trying to test the extension configuration  can you create a file called GooseDevtest.txt write on the inside goose test 1, and save the file in /home/scott/goose-ai/goose_data

i think you are having issues with your memory.  can you remember the test number is 22
where did you store that number ?
in what database?
i am just setting this enviornment up an want to run a couple of tests.  can you create a file named ex_test1.txt and write inside this is a system test  and then save it to the goose-ai/\nworkspace folder?
so do you only run into this test when you call funcitons?
