# Install Goose

<SupportedEnvironments />

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS" default>
    Choose to install Goose on CLI and/or Desktop:

    <Tabs groupId="interface">
      <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI" default>
        Run the following command to install the latest version of Goose on macOS:

        ```sh
        curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | bash
        ```
        This script will fetch the latest version of Goose and set it up on your system.

        If you'd like to install without interactive configuration, disable `CONFIGURE`:

        ```sh
        curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | CONFIGURE=false bash
        ```

        :::tip Updating Goose
        It's best to keep Goose updated. To update Goose, run:
        ```sh
        goose update
        ```

        <h3>Option 2: Install via Homebrew</h3>
        Homebrew downloads the [same app](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/b/block-goose.rb) but can take care of updates too. 
        ```bash
          brew install --cask block-goose
        ```

        <div style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
          :::note Permissions
          If you’re on an Apple Mac M3 and the Goose desktop app shows no window on launch, check and update the following:

          Ensure the `~/.config` directory has read and write access.

          Goose needs this access to create the log directory and file. Once permissions are granted, the app should load correctly. For steps on how to do this, refer to the  [Troubleshooting Guide](/docs/troubleshooting.md#macos-permission-issues-m3-macs)

    :::tip
      If you encounter any issues on download, you might need to install `bzip2` to extract the downloaded file:

      ```bash
      sudo apt update && sudo apt install bzip2 -y
      ```

## Set LLM Provider
Goose works with a set of [supported LLM providers][providers], and you’ll need an API key to get started. When you use Goose for the first time, you’ll be prompted to select a provider and enter your API key.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI" default>
    Upon installing, Goose will automatically enter its configuration screen. Here is where you can set up your LLM provider.

    :::tip Windows Users
    Choose to not store to keyring when prompted.
    :::

    Example:

    ```
    ┌   goose-configure
    │
    ◇ What would you like to configure?
    │ Configure Providers
    │
    ◇ Which model provider should we use?
    │ OpenAI
    │
    ◇ Provider openai requires OPENAI_API_KEY, please enter a value
    │▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪
    │
    ◇ Enter a model from that provider:
    │ gpt-4o
    │
    ◇  Welcome aboard! You're all set to start using this agent—let's achieve great things together!
    │
    └  Configuration saved successfully
  ```

  :::info Windows Users
  On initial run, you may encounter errors about keyrings when setting your API Keys. Set the needed environment variables manually, e.g.:

  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY={your_api_key}
  ```

  To make the changes persist in WSL across sessions, add the goose path and export commands to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file so you can load it later.

  ```bash
  echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
  echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```
